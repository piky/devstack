      Base job for devstack-based functional tests that use tox.

      This job is not intended to be run directly. It's just here
      for organizational purposes for devstack-tox-functional and
      devstack-tox-functional-consumer.

      Base job for devstack-based functional tests that use tox.

      Runs devstack, then runs the tox ``functional`` environment,
      then collects tox/testr build output like normal tox jobs.

      Turns off tox sibling installation. Projects may be involved
      in the devstack deployment and so may be in the required-projects
      list, but may not want to test against master of the other
      projects in their tox env. Child jobs can set tox_install_siblings
      to True to re-enable sibling processing.

      Base job for devstack-based functional tests for projects that
      consume the devstack cloud.

      This base job should only be used by projects that are not involved
      in the devstack deployment step, but are instead projects that are using
      devstack to get a cloud against which they can test things.

      Runs devstack in pre-run, then runs the tox ``functional`` environment,
      then collects tox/testr build output like normal tox jobs.

      Turns off tox sibling installation. Projects may be involved
      in the devstack deployment and so may be in the required-projects
      list, but may not want to test against master of the other
      projects in their tox env. Child jobs can set tox_install_siblings
      to True to re-enable sibling processing.
