We source the library files like this nova-plugin into the same shell as we\u0027re working in; e.g. it\u0027s really the same as\n\n $ cat a.sh\n #!/bin/bash\n function foo {\n   echo $1\n }\n source b.sh\n\n $ cat b.sh\n foo \"hello\"\n\nwhich would print \"hello\"\n\nSo I might need some more context to understand how this is actually failing?",
