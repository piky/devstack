However, since the concern over the mis-reporting of things like neutron\u0027s API stats was brought up, I\u0027d propose this as a workaround, if we\u0027re adamant that we must do something.\n\nFiltering what we index somewhere else makes it less-obvious and less-accessible for most people to adjust as necessary. So if we\u0027re going to do it, I think we should do it here.",
