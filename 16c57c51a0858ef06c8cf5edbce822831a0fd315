We\u0027re not releasing from the EM branches any more, so I don\u0027t think we need to test upgrades.  We can leave it as a non-voting job as a signal to distros still supporting train that they may need to watch out.  Although, presumably they\u0027re doing their own downstream testing, and running grenade variants upstream on EM branches is a waste of resources IMO.",
