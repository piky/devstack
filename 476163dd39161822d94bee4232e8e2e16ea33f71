      "message": "I found that we already have something similar in place for older branches that still support py27, see https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/devstack/+/772486/, I guess you could adapt your patch based on that. You\u0027ll also need to start with the oldest stable branch, otherwise grenade jobs will still fail.",

We don\u0027t store the python3.6 get-pip.py in the cache, so I\u0027ll keep your suggestion to wipe out local_pip in this case.\n\nOnce I have this patch merged, I\u0027ll cherry-pick to stable releases.",
