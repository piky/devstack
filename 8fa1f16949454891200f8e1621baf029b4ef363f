      "message": "We get a /48 as random prefix in total, we use a /64 from it for FIXED_RANGE_V6 and I want to avoid overlapping the subnet pool range with that one. So we could make it a /49 at most, but having odd netmasks that don\u0027t align with byte boundaries are ugly IMHO. So the natural solution is using the next /56 after the one occupied by FIXED_RANGE_V6, which is what I did.",
