That said, Mint is clearly ubuntu/debian-ish enough to work.\n\nSo I\u0027d prefer to just see a line for LinuxMint added lumping it with these distros, similar to the way oraclelinux is grouped with rhel.  we already match on LinuxMint in os_PACKAGE anyway",

I still dont believe the proper behavior is to die considering the amount of redhat and debian derivatives out there. I am willing to support the version we work off of to get us going on, but would like this to work for others that may not be in the supported list still.",

      "message": "So, I think we might have two different thigns\n\n1) there is a bit of a regression in FORCE\u003dyes ... maybe.  previously, we would pick up some default value for DISTRO and you could continue on with FORCE\u003dyes.  Now we just bail\n\n2) In this LinuxMint case, it seems that FORCE\u003dyes was not previously required because I think we fell back to debian matching.  \n\nSo\n\n1) We should probably add a catch-all DISTRO setting, but only if FORCE is set.  That can be a separate change\n\n2) We should formalise how we\u0027re matching LinuxMint so this isn\u0027t just working by happy accident.  I\u0027m fine if that\u0027s just matching os_VENDOR of Mint and say \"this is enough like debian we just use that\"",
