      "message": "Is the intent in giving the host the $EXT_GW_IP to allow the host to route externally over an interface that is not a port on $PUBLIC_BRIDGE? If that\u0027s the case, then maybe destroying and re-creating $PUBLIC_BRIDGE is OK. But I thought the discussion had been heading towards letting the user pre-configure the $PUBLIC_BRIDGE with a physical interface as a port, and potentially using this same bridge for VLANs. Can you clarify? I apologize if I\u0027m missing the point.",
