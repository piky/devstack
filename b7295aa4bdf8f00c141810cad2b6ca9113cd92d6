      "message": "I\u0027d venture to suggest that what most people care about is just the version number. So I\u0027d prefer to see this configured as\n\n QEMU_VERSION\u003d2.1.0-rc2\n LIBVIRT_VERSION\u003d1.2.6\n\nNow, I realize OpenStack infra team might want to mirror the libvirt/QEMU downloads locally to lower risk of gate failures due to transient network problems, so we could *optionally* allow\n\n QEMU_URL\u003dhttp://wiki.qemu-project.org/download/qemu-::VERSION::.tar.\n LIBVIRT_URL\u003dhttp://libvirt.org/sources/libvirt-::VERSION::.tar.gz\n\nand so the string ::VERSION:: is replaced by the value of $LIBVIRT_VERSION. The key thing here is that 99% of people will only need to care about setting the short LIBVIRT_VERSION env. Only the people running gate systems with local cache will need to deal with the longer URL setting.",
