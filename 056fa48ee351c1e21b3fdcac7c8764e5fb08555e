I know very little about this.  \n\nFrom what I can tell in I6afbdecea637f7e7d3417be537ab71fe97bffda3 and reading the code a bit this is saying the configuration is shared?  would we not just delete this bit in the LVM side all together?",

      "message": "That review is from 2013, not sure it still applied. And it says \"At some point we shoudl restructure this a bit to allow multi-backends to specify independent settings for these configs.\" \n\nI don\"t really want to dig into the history but, without this patch, \"dd if\u003d/dev/zero ...\" is called on LVM volumes even if SECURE_DELETE\u003dTrue. Moreover, CINDER_VOLUME_CLEAR is deprecated for more than 1 year, so every patch to removes its usage in DevStack is a good patch :)",
