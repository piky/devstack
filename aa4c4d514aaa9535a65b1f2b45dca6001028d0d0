      "message": "So I queried the last 7 days of runs of the \"devstack\" job where they were successful, on master branch, and extracted the osc timing metric.  The results are in [1]; in short 292s with a standard deviation of 50\n\nThis run reported \n\n osc                  168\n\nso you could draw some conclusions maybe that even if you went down the bell curve to about 242 seconds being a fast run, we were still ~74 seconds lower here.\n\nBut I would like to see this using the timer wrappers to get accounting from the start; maybe we want some new category that\u0027s not quite like \"osc\" but \"api\" or something -- to indicate time we\u0027re talking to the cloud and setting things up (as opposed to installing things, etc).\n\n[1] https://ethercalc.openstack.org/rzuhevxz7793",
