      "message": "quantum itself does not start with q-, and there are currently no services that do start with q that aren\u0027t quantum. I can add a second block for q-, and change this to quantum, or we can leave this as-is until there are actually non-quantum q prefixed services (which is my preference, as its less code).",

      "message": "The name \u0027quantum\u0027 is a special-cased name that gets included in file_to_parse as a result of any of the quantum services being enabled.  That is the entire point of these special cases. \u0027quantum\u0027 is not itself the name of a service and should not be used as if it were.  Either use \u0027q-\u0027 or some string longer than \u0027q\u0027 to prefix all of the quantum service names.  Using something that is not \u0027q-\u0027 will require changing every occurrence of quantum service names in devstack.",
