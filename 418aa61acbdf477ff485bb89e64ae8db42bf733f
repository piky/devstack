      "message": "Thanks. Yes this section is what is braking every other suse distro. We need to either check sles, or mor generically simply skip if there is no TEMP_PASSWORD in /var/log/mysql/mysqld.log\nThe generic purpose of this section is to get past the scenario where a TEMP_PASSWORD has been defined in myslq by default during installation. so it is meant to actually cover more than just sles.. I know its splitting hairs but I think we should keep this patch generic and follow up with a more specific patch for sles. \n\nI should remove the reference to SLES in the comment!",
