      "message": "Didn\u0027t get you saying \"GIT_REF is changed\". If tag is re-tagged (points to a new commit) the clause with  git_update_tag $GIT_REF will be executed anyway as GIT_REF is still a tag. And such a case will be handled successfully. Most likely the only way the code gets clause you are talking about is if GIT_REF is a commit hash (like ff5981b59b6fc5b280af101c2309acb5b7324dab). Yes, I find it\u0027s quite useful replacing with \"git checkout $GIT_REF\" here, but perhaps with forcing (-f). Actually I already did that pointing to specific commit.",
