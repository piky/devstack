      "message": "This is ok, but it can be improved by adopting nova\u0027s approach, which lets the application choose the appropriate pipeline depending on AUTH_STRATEGY.\n\nThe difference would be that we would not need in the future to change devstack for each change in the Quantum pipelines.\n\nAlternatively, Glance approach can also be considered, where a \"flavor\" (eg: keystone) is specified through iniset in the conf file.",

      "message": "I agreed too. More general approach should be adopted. The current approach is very adhoc.\n\nI looked both approaches in Nova and Glance. I feel that nova\u0027s approach is more flexible. Glance\u0027s \u0027flavor\u0027 approach just switches the appname (top of the paste hierarchy).\n\nWe need to modify the quantum code itself to support this. we need to decide to use the current adhoc approach at this moment or introduce the config option for auth strategy to quantum.\n\nI will appreciate more advice for the direction.",
