To me, testing with modern python and current pip is more important than testing some legacy setup.\n\nIf there were sufficient contributors working on devstack, I\u0027d probably agree with you, but currently it is difficult enough to keep the main jobs reasonably in shape.",

      "message": "I\u0027m still not on board with this ... it makes the test just rather pointless.  Nobody running openstack in any sort of production on centos7 will be using python 3.6 ... the only point of this testing is to be a cow-catcher of major issues that might affect downstream that we can fix before they get there.  Any time spent fixing IUS python3.6 issues on centos7 is really just wasted; I just don\u0027t see it making sense to use this",
