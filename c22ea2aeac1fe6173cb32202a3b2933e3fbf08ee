      "message": "Well, this needs to happen when the cinder API is up is being poked for runtime config (which is here). The lib/glance module itself doesn\u0027t seem to poke cinder anywhere, and doesn\u0027t really have any equivalent \"do this once all the APIs are up\" function, other than the uploading of the image.\n\nIf you think this is important enough to add a new toplevel function in lib/glance and call that from stack.sh I can surely do that, but it seems like a lot of overhead.\n\nThis function is, in spirit, \"configure the runtime stuff in cinder so other services can use it\" which makes this fit well here.",
