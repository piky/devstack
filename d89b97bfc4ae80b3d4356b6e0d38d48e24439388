      "message": "Because when I started this it was just about the database and I wasn\u0027t sure where it was all going. It ended up being an ansible role and collecting a lot more than DB stuff and having that enabled all the time made sense. I still think that there should be a flag to avoid the MYSQL data collection, because that *could* have some perf impact to people and should be disable-able.\n\nBut yeah, I haven\u0027t considered this since the first rev that had it as a flag, so I will happily enable by default :)",
