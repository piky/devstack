Now we want to add new job for (nova + glance) to use this multiple stores feature with its plugins like copy-image existing image in multiple stores, convert image from qcow2 to raw etc.\n\nAt this moment OSC has not support for these new features/commands so we need to use glance client instead.\n\n[1] https://docs.openstack.org/glance/latest/admin/interoperable-image-import.html",
