      "message": "I\u0027ve never tried to install devstack over vmWare. Google has found some articles for me, http://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2013/07/how-to-quickly-get-started-with-vmware.html e.g. . But it\u0027s rather old one. Could you please share the latest HOW-TO? And the next question: from the article above I see VMWAREAPI_CLUSTER param. Why isn\u0027t it configured here?",

      "message": "We had followed https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/NovaVMware/DeveloperGuide for using Devstack with vsphere. A techpaper (http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/techpaper/VMWare-Getting-Started-with-OpenStack-and-vSphere.pdf) is available to use openstack with vsphere.\n\nVMWAREAPI_CLUSTER parameter is needed for other openstack components like nova and cinder to specify the cluster in vsphere which is being managed by the particular installation of the service (nova/cinder). However, for ceilometer, it is not needed as the APIs which we call in ceilometer do not rely on this parameter. Hence, have not included it.",
