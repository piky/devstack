Is there anything else to verify we\u0027re dealing with an ovf file?  I\u0027d think there is something as you are trying to handle a very specific file type.",

      "message": "To be honest, this is not strictly an ovf. I used ovf, because the XenServer images are using ovf as a container format in glance to refer to the same structure (vhd chain inside a tar.gz) (to be honest, this new thing is just a tar.gz with one file in it, so we would better say, that the container format is .tgz).\n\nLet me look at glance, and see, if any other container format could be used. If that\u0027s the case, we might want to use --disk-format\u003draw --container-format\u003dtgz.\n\nRegarding to the image extension, I think we could pick anything. What about:\n\n  .rawdisk.tgz",
