Is there anything else to verify we\u0027re dealing with an ovf file?  I\u0027d think there is something as you are trying to handle a very specific file type.",

      "message": "To be honest, this is not strictly an ovf. I used ovf, because the XenServer images are using ovf as a container format in glance to refer to the same structure (vhd chain inside a tar.gz) (to be honest, this new thing is just a tar.gz with one file in it, so we would better say, that the container format is .tgz).\n\nLet me look at glance, and see, if any other container format could be used. If that\u0027s the case, we might want to use --disk-format\u003draw --container-format\u003dtgz.\n\nRegarding to the image extension, I think we could pick anything. What about:\n\n  .rawdisk.tgz",

      "message": "I know the combinations of container-format and real-world use is not well documented, my real issue was just that we already had a handler for *.tgz and *.raw.tgz seems really generic and obvious that it is a raw image inside a gzipped tar file.  Or that\u0027s how I would read it.\n\nThat said, the existing handler does assume *.tgz has image, kernel and ramdisk files in it so this may not be a bad move.  That only leaves the ovf container-format and the vm_mode property setting to resolve, i.e. I don\u0027t think generic *.raw.tgz files should have those.  Is there some way you might pick that up, like out of the filename?",
