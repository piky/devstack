      "message": "I thought about that, but the behavior is \"create directory and create symlink\" - while we could have a generic function for this, it still seems quite a specific set of functionality to these two cases\n\nI thought about create_sr_directory, but that doesn\u0027t deal with it creating symlinks or create_utility_directory but it\u0027s a bit weird to specify two names for the directory (maybe we could generate the SR path from the real path...)\n\nit just seemed like there wasn\u0027t an easy fit for a generic function - particularly where we want to reduce the usage of it to use directories directly on the SR.",
