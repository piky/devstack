One can run openstack \u0027externally\u0027 and simply point to the running opendaylight. \n\nIn short, I think the clonning of $ODL_NETWORKING_URL needs to be done by anything that uses opendaylight as ml2. Is there a known location for that? In my local.conf, I\u0027m using odl-compute and that would fail because ODL_NETWORKING_URL is never installed:\n\nscreen-q-svc.log:2015-02-03 14:55:43.171 31366 ERROR stevedore.extension [-] Could not load \u0027opendaylight\u0027: No module named networking_odl.common",
