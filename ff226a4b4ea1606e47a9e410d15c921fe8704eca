I think it\u0027s better to add this snippet to lib/neutron_third_party/vmware_nsx (no issue will arise from the fact that you clone vmware-nsx before we move out the code from openstack/neutron).\n\nIf this will create weird import situation we can create a lib/neutron_thirdparty/vmware module with common functions which will be imported by vmware_nsx and vmware_nsx_v",
