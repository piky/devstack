      "message": "https://trunk.rdoproject.org/centos9-master/delorean-deps.repo url as the location to configure the RDO Trunk dependencies repository for the master branch has been one stable way of pulling it since the initial bootstrap for CentOS9 (before it was https://trunk.rdoproject.org/centos8-master/delorean-deps.repo ) so I guess we can consider it long-lived one.\n\nFor stable releases, installilng centos-release-openstack-\u003crelease name\u003e from CentOS repos has been the standard way of configuring RDO official repositories for years and there is no intent to change it. Also, it works for Rocky Linux as they provide a rebuild of the package in their repos.\n\nIs this the information you were looking for?",
