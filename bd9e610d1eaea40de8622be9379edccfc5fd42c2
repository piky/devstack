I don\u0027t think configure_keystone() (and hence ensure_certificates() ) gets called more than once per stack.sh run.  Do you want the certs to persist across runs?\n\nI don\u0027t think this would be an issue in Grenade ad configure_keystone() is not used during the upgrade and the certs should persist there.",
