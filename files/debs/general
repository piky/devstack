# The reason for python3-openssl is somewhat circuitous and convoluted.
# Debian debundles pip's dependencies. By default this does not include
# pyopenssl or cryptography. However, openstack depends on both pyopenssl
# and cryptography which means they both get installed via pypi. Novnc
# depends on the python3-cryptography distro package. The end results is
# we get cryotography installed via both distro package and pypi and
# openssl only via pypi. When pip uses debundled urllib3 it finds pypi
# openssl and distro cryptography which are not compatible with each other
# causing pip installs to fail. If we install python3-openssl then debundled
# pip finds distro versions of both openssl and cryptography and pip works.
