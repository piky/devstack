      "message": "I was curious why there was a difference in output, running each under strace shows why - brctl opens /sys/class/net and pokes around, bridge opens a netlink socket and makes a call.  For some reason the netlink way doesn\u0027t return things like docker0 that brctl does.  In the end the below /sbin/ip output is going to show us all the interfaces, so the brctl show isn\u0027t getting us much anyways.",
