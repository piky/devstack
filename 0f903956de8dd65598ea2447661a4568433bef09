      "message": "Instead of doing this in devstack, I wonder whether we should move the multiattach tests that require admin intervention to the \u0027tempest.api.volume.admin\u0027 package.  There\u0027s already a precedent for this in tempest:\n\nhttps://opendev.org/openstack/tempest/src/branch/master/tempest/api/volume/admin/test_volume_type_access.py\n\nThe tests in that file are checking to see if a regular end-user can access/not access private volume types.  The admin creates the volume-type and sets the access, and then the regular user tries to use the volume type.  So I\u0027d argue that it makes sense for the multiattach tests, which require admin and regular end-user collaboration, to be in the \u0027admin\u0027 package as well.",

      "message": "I am not saying we cannot verify the multiataach operation by keeping the test in admin or non admin dir. Technically any test in any dir can request for set of creds to verify the things. \n\nBut main purpose of having ../admin/ dir and tests under them if to separate the tests need and executed by admin users vs non admin. for example anyone should be able to run tempest on env not having admin users. Interop certification program is one example.\n\nIf we move multiattach test to admin dir(I mean test need admin creds) then interop will not be able to test this as interop capability or anyone not having admin creds not able to run this.\n\nBy creating the volume_type in devstck and configure in tempest will test the multiattach operation as close to the end users. Same way we do create flavor for nova instances.",
