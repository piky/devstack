      "message": "I agree with Aaron in general that the default path for LBaaS plugin is helpful.\nMy idea is to introduce two config parameters Q_ENABLE_LBAAS and Q_LBAAS_PLUGIN (which points to the default lbaas plugin class). If Q_ENABLE_LBAAS is True, Q_LBAAS_PLUGIN is added to Q_SERVICE_PLUGINS.\nBy doing it, we can enable/disable LBaaS and switch LBaaS plugin.",

      "message": "Yeah, I considered approaches like that, but I was worried that it would not be flexible as we move forward.  If you look at how the services plugin stuff works, there\u0027s nothing that says a services plugin can implement only lbaas, or that you will have just one lbaas plugin.  \n\nSo while we could make it work that way for now, we\u0027d probably have to change it in the future and end up breaking people\u0027s existing setups. \n\nOne though I did have was to say that if you have q-lbaas agent enabled, we should make sure you have the corresponding services plugin enabled, but even that may change in the future, I\u0027m not sure.  Let me think about this some more.",
