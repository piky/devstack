We have out of tree plugins that integrate with Neutron today, and do not have config files located in the neutron repo (and never have - for instance [1]), and they seem to integrate without issues.\n\nSo why this extra level of indirection? I\u0027ll keep on reading...\n\n[1] https://github.com/openstack/networking-l2gw/",

It might be need to be polished, but it doesn\u0027t seem to require this new logic you\u0027re proposing.\n\nCan you elaborate in light of my notes?",
