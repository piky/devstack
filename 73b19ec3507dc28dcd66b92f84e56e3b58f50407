      "message": "It is really confusing... until now, q-agt has almost a same meaning as \"quantum data network node\".\n\nI am looking for a way to avoid duplicated codes. Several options are:\n- define another keywork (q-ovs?)\n- still use q-agt and do not execute q-agt if AGENT_BINARY is an empty string\n\nAny idea?\n(If there is no good way, the current solution is also ok)",

      "message": "Had a bit of this discussion with Gary K and Dan W on this before I submitted this patch. The objective was to keep changes limited to bigswitch_floodlight plugin in this patch (and cause minimal churn in the OVS-related code-paths). A general refactoring of Quantum pluigns\u0027 related code can be done as a separate patch.",
