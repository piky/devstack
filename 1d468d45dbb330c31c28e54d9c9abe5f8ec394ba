      "message": "I was looking into this, apparently this method is already invoked in the plugin.sh in neutron [0], just like other extensions such as DNS, qos etc...\n\nWe could then just remove it from here because it\u0027s redundant.\n\nAlso, in one of the patches that we have testing this code, I noticed that we are hitting [1] when we leave Q_ML2_PLUGIN_EXT_DRIVERS as the default we have in ovn_agent at the moment. Apparently the \"dns\" extensions is colliding with other dns extensions that get enabled when the q-dns/neutron-dns service is enabled, also in plugin.sh [0].\n\nI will do a follow up patch fixing those.\n\n[0] https://github.com/openstack/neutron/blob/master/devstack/plugin.sh#L101-L103\n[1] https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1887163",
