This is better than where it was being done before, but it still seems wrong to mention a specific version here. Are there other examples of us doing this in devstack?",

      "message": "I didn\u0027t say \"a single change\" would do it, it just feels like the job config is the proper place and not devstack. Devstack should be as timeless as possible (IMHO) and not need modifications to run because of specific current conditions. These sorts of hacks make it hard(er) to run devstack on older releases when you need to do a backport or something.\n\nThe example you cite is totally different - it\u0027s setting a flag for behavior based on the distro version. That\u0027s entirely different and much less of a concern than picking an arbitrary python version for a given distro, for a short period if time, and which isn\u0027t even installed by/for the distro itself.",
