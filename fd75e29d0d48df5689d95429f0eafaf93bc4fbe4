This is better than where it was being done before, but it still seems wrong to mention a specific version here. Are there other examples of us doing this in devstack?",

      "message": "I didn\u0027t say \"a single change\" would do it, it just feels like the job config is the proper place and not devstack. Devstack should be as timeless as possible (IMHO) and not need modifications to run because of specific current conditions. These sorts of hacks make it hard(er) to run devstack on older releases when you need to do a backport or something.\n\nThe example you cite is totally different - it\u0027s setting a flag for behavior based on the distro version. That\u0027s entirely different and much less of a concern than picking an arbitrary python version for a given distro, for a short period if time, and which isn\u0027t even installed by/for the distro itself.",

I think doing it in job side is better and will be clear if anyone update/fix/look into those jobs for newer python. keeping the hack here will be hidden for many people.\n\nOn multiple place fixes, you can set the same in devstack in-tree defined base jobs. I hope those might be the base for many of c9s/rocky jobs and might not require fixes other places but if required, let\u0027s do it on job side.\n\nFYI, I propose to stop running those jobs as they are 100% failing, once you pin the pythin version, i can abandon mine - https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/devstack/+/948592",
