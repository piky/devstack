      "message": "So if Ironic is using resource classes, this change will cause the non-ironic filters to be used instead of the ironic filters. I don\u0027t believe that that is the desired behavior. If resource classes are used, then the list of baremetal filters should have the ram/cpu/disk filters removed.",
