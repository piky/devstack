      "message": "I was first thinking whether this could be a bug in bash, but it could also be intended but badly documented behavior. Comparing to other uses of `-n` the missing quotes seem to be more relevant, though.\n\nI also checked that this is actually the only occurrence of `[ -n ... ]` without quotes in our code, so no other hidden issues afaict.",

So a more standard fix would be:\n\nif [ -n \"$config_file\" ]; then\n\nalso dropping the unneeded braces, which would make the code more in line with the remainder of this plugin.",
