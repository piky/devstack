      "message": "If those are outside of nova, is it possible they\u0027re sourcing lib/placement and not sourcing lib/nova and will therefore break despite the method name having remained unchanged?\n\nTo remain super-duper backward compatible, presumably one would have to make the original function in lib/placement a shim like\n\n if \u003cfancy typeset output doesn\u0027t contain real_method_name\u003e; then\n     source lib/nova\n fi\n real_method_name \"$@\"\n\nBasically I\u0027m wondering if there\u0027s value in retaining the method name if we\u0027re not going to be super careful about it. And if we\u0027re not (which I\u0027m actually fine with - let those plugins break and do the right thing to fix themselves - presumably put a similar method in their own lib/*) then we should rename the method to what we think is right (which would be what, remove _nova_compute?)",
