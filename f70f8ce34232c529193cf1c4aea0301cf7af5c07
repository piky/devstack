      "message": "just a suggestion. Since we already have IRONIC_DEPLOY_* (eg IRONIC_DEPLOY_FLAVOR), how about either\n 1. IRONIC_DEPLOY_ISCSI_WITH_IPA \u003d true/false\n 2. IRONIC_DEPLOY_ISCSI \u003d \u0027ipa\u0027\n\nAlso wondering, I see we have \u0027is_deployed_by_agent\u0027. Is there a distinction between \u0027IPA\u0027 and \u0027agent\u0027 or do they mean the same thing? If the same thing, maybe we should use \u0027agent\u0027 here too? Although I like \u0027IPA\u0027 because it is more specific. I know, jroll doesn\u0027t want to think of another agent that isn\u0027t based on IPA ;)",
