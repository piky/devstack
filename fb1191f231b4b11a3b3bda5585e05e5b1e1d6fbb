      "message": "Just a short hint that the nova doc suggests using \"n-sproxy\" a the screen name for the nova-serialproxy service [1]. I have no favorite for the name, but I strongly suggest to make the name equal in both guides. I suggest to let the nova guide reference this guide in their section \"Setting up a devstack environemnt\".\n\n[1] http://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/devref/testing/serial-console.html",

      "message": "Okay I take your point about having things match.  Once this in devstack I\u0027ll update the nova devref to point here as the \"source of truth\".\n\nI\u0027d rather have the docs in devstack rather than nova.  An alternate would be to replace this guide to a link to the nova docs as duplicate guides are silly.\n\nThoughts?",

So this brings up 2 points.\n\n1) there isn\u0027t a good way to link to that table directly ; and\n2) that table is missing some config options\n\nI\u0027ll address both of those with the docs team.\n\nI like this here as it allows a developer to copy\u0027n\u0027paste that hunk into local.conf and run with it.  \n\nIf you don\u0027t see that as helpful then I can change it.\n(note that isn\u0027t meant to sound passive aggressive, just trying to explain my POV)",
