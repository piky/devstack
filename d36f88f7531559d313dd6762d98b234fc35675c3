I think while the master branch still ostensibly supports python2/CentOS 7 we leave it as is -- the point of it is to flag issues on master before they make it down further to other projects.  Not that I\u0027d pretend devstack is close to any sort of production deployment, but using this puts it a even further away from any way that openstack is actually being used on centos in the wild, so really makes the testing much less useful IMO.",
