      "message": "Yeah, please. I was originally async\u0027ing the neutron startup as well and stopped because we need it to be up before the network creation on L1291 anyway. So it\u0027s quite possible that I should have just removed this async as well.\n\nI think probably what would be good is to move all of this to a start_neutron_stuff() function and just async_runfunc that. I\u0027m not sure that the logic and separation need to be exposed in stack.sh at this layer anyway, and doing so would let those things happen in serial as needed, while we do other things here like starting nova and placement.",

      "message": "Hi,\n\nThanks Brian and Dan.\n\nDan, I think you are correct here, this needs to be up and running before we attempt to create the initial networks. \n\nThe ML2/OVN driver will wait for the OVN services to start in case Neutron is started first (L1283) but, I believe any request coming at that time will fail as the OVN database connection won\u0027t be initialized.\n\nThe idea of refactoring the code to have a start_neutron_stuff() method which we can run async should work better.",
