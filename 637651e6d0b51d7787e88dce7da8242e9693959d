      "message": "This line jumps out to me due to the two lines above it. In particular we are taking three steps:\n\n  707. Install tempest and all of its deps into venv-tempest using constraints\n  709. Install tempest and all of its deps into venv-tempest using a possibly different constraints file\n  710. Install tempest and all of its deps without a constraints file\n  \nAdditionally, we only guard line 707 for running offline. I think this effectively means that tempest installations cannot happen during an offline run of devstack.\n\nMy suggestion for fixing this is that we figure out what the install we need/want actually is and perform that in a single line and guard that properly with the offline check.",
