      "message": "known_stores is now `stores` and the stores are not expressed with the full path. This would be:\n\n  iniset $GLANCE_API_CONF glance_store stores \"file, http, rbd\"\n\nAlso, all the stores params should now go into the `glance_store` group (see the line above). This is working because backwards compatibility was kept but, if this patch is not meant to be backported, I\u0027d recommend using `glance_store` directly (the rbd options below should be moved as well).",
