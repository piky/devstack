      "message": "this change basically will handle below two use case-\n\n1. NEUTRON_CREATE_INITIAL_NETWORKS is true when neutron create initial network but you want to skip setting the public_network_id\n- Not sure why we need to skip public_network_id and so does tempest tests external connectivity checks also.\n\n2. NEUTRON_CREATE_INITIAL_NETWORKS is false where there is no network created by neutron but we do have neutron\u0027s public network available in env ? \n- This seems valid case.\n\nlet me know if my understanding is correct?",
