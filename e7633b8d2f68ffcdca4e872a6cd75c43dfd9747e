      "message": "and it might be useful if it accepted a list of extensions rather than a single one? And return True if *all* are supported?\n\nIn this case, we might want to check for both router and external_net\n\nThis would ensure that this conditional block would be executed based on whether Neutron supports this capability rather than having the developer say he/she wants to execute this block or not.",

      "message": "so we will need to list in the localconf the extension that we want to support and those that are l3 related. just the simple flag seems so much simpler.\nwhat in a plugin has a extension that has the word router and it does not support routers. That can lead to false positives. But maybe I am going on tangent here.",
