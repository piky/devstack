      "message": "One, note while this is good for testing and being able to debug this patch. We don\u0027t want to do this when we land the patch. What will happen is when someone tries to use tempest the old way (straight from the repo) is that they\u0027ll end up with all of their logs and state artifacts stored in the workspace instead of here. Which I imagine would be confusing. But until we un-WIP this I think we should leave it just to make debugging easier",
