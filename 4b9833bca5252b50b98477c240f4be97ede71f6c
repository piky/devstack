      "message": "I tried that, but even minutes after rabbitmq first started the password change was still failing.  I had to actually restart the service to make it work, so that\u0027s why the loop is around restart.\n\nI can probably reduce the duplication by moving the is_fedora || is_suse check inside the loop and then doing the loop for all distros.  I\u0027ll give it a try and see if it cleans things up or just makes them worse. :-)",
