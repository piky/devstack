I think there is potential for additional refactoring there. Like maybe we don\u0027t need a full restart for adding a new uwsgi service (I don\u0027t know). As well as the idea of increasing the systemd restart limits\"\n\nhttps://meetings.opendev.org/irclogs/%23openstack-qa/%23openstack-qa.2025-03-26.log.html#t2025-03-26T17:10:57",
