      "message": "I think you should make it explicit here whether services that devstack is currently eating should plan to migrate to plugin at some point in the future, or whether that is a non goal.\n\nPersonally I think all services, including the compute kernel, should be devstack plugins. I\u0027m relatively certain that is technically possible but less certain that it is practical or pragmatic.",
