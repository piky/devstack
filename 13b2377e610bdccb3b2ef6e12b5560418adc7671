      "message": "This seems fairly sensible ... but then also does break the status quo from when the change was originally added.  I had a look at the old spec [1] and it wasn\u0027t explicitly discussed.\n\nI think the problem at this point is that it effectively an external interface ... I have no idea if people are installing a plugin that always lives on master on all their branches and we\u0027d break them, or indeed if their plugin comes from branches named differently to TARGET_BRANCH, etc.\n\nSo I think to be 100% safe, we could probably create a simple wrapper function that sets the branch to TARGET_BRANCH, e.g. follows the current branch.  \"enable_plugin_for_current_branch\" is maybe too long but that\u0027s the idea...\n\n[1] https://review.openstack.org/#/c/137054/9/specs/devstack/devstack-external-plugins.rst",
