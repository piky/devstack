      "message": "The logic is a bit ugly here, but while the first operand of the or is a test, the latter is an exit status. We could have converted the exit status into a variable and then use a test for the second operand.\n\nI admit I do not know how bash evaluates or condition, but in this case is multi_value is \u0027add\u0027 then the second part should not be evaluated at all, which probably makes sense.",

How does this behave when $multi_value and non-$multi_value are mixed?  Can it handle replacing one or more MultiStrOpt options, leaving the rest alone?  This might require much more work than what you have provided.",

Also, I don\u0027t think we have a need to replace a given entry in a multi string option at the moment. If  you deem it necessary however, I am happy to work on it.",
