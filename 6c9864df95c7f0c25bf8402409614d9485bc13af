      "message": "so this is getting to my point ... we already have branching in here for several architectures.  is whatever you\u0027re doing so specific to your third-party CI that anyone else who tried things out on PPC64LE would *not* need these settings?\n\nI understand people trying devstack on PPC64LE is probably a community of just you -- but the alternative seems to be to just add whatever flags you need into the existing code path. \n\nif it\u0027s generic, we should add it to devstack.  if it\u0027s too specific, no point.  This is why adding context helps us make good decisions!",
