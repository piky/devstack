      "message": "Right, I notice that from Nova\u0027s git, \u0027kvm\u0027 is hard-coded. However, DevStack falls back to QEMU[2] if it doesn\u0027t detect KVM (i..e if the /dev/kvm character device is not present). So, I\u0027ll probably reword this section so that (a) \u0027virt_type\u003dkvm\u0027 is default in Nova and (b) users might want to ensure hardware virtualization is enabled in BIOS and /dev/kvm Character device is present.\n\nThanks for the comment.\n\n[1] http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova/tree/nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py#n122\n[2] http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-dev/devstack/tree/lib/nova#n282",
