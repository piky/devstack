      "message": "Using review.o.o as git source is bad in two ways. The gerrit server is a single machine not made for the high load of cloning the complete repositories, so if we really need to use an external git repo, it should be https://opendev.org.\n\nBut even that would defeat all the effort we put into making pre-cache local checkouts available on our testing images, so we should really put some more work into being able to use those here, I don\u0027t see a hard reason why that shouldn\u0027t be possible.",

      "message": "I understand but tag does not work with existing checkout repo. git_clone here[1] does not take tag if repo already exit and RECLONE is false (as per git_clone logic). I tried that during ocata pinning so did with gerrit ref.\n\ntempest repo is not so heavy so i think it should be fine. later we can sort out the tag working by adjusting in logic and backport that in all stable branches. \n\n[1] https://opendev.org/openstack/devstack/src/commit/f9a6986b90f896f2c0d122ae2572411f9c13f506/lib/tempest",
