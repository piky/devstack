      "message": "Using review.o.o as git source is bad in two ways. The gerrit server is a single machine not made for the high load of cloning the complete repositories, so if we really need to use an external git repo, it should be https://opendev.org.\n\nBut even that would defeat all the effort we put into making pre-cache local checkouts available on our testing images, so we should really put some more work into being able to use those here, I don\u0027t see a hard reason why that shouldn\u0027t be possible.",
