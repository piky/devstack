      "message": "No, I\u0027m happy to just set it, but I expected pushback for doing so. People do have to increase this number for large and busy deployments, but certainly not always. And increasing the default makes a real deployment worse in general because we don\u0027t notice that a compute service is dead and keep sending things to it for the rest of the interval, which becomes a serious magnet. The scheduler continues to see the dead compute as a good place to send new builds, so more go there for as long as it takes to realize it\u0027s a bad idea.\n\nSo I expected the argument for making it a variable in devstack is that the average devstack deployment should use the service defaults as much as possible, and a single or dual-node devstack for development definitely can handle the defaults. It\u0027s really the over-taxed CI workers that need the exception.\n\nIt\u0027s easier for me to just bump it always, so if that\u0027s the preference, I\u0027m happy to simplify this.",
