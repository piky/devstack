      "message": "This is a nit, but the naming here is confusing. This should probably be \"set_glance_api_conf\" or something. It has nothing to do with glance_store (AFAICT). I\u0027m also not sure it really saves anything since it\u0027s just implying the \"iniset $GLANCE_API_CONF\" which is maybe not much different than \"set_glance_store_params\" and it makes it harder to see what\u0027s going on in the places from which it\u0027s used :)",
