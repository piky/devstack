I assume there\u0027s some overlap between the options used by nova-compute and nova-conductor? If so, this disconnect is probably unavoidable but if not, we should probably break up \u0027configure_console_proxies\u0027 further.\n\nI think you touched on this in [1]\n\n[1] https://review.openstack.org/550141",

      "message": "That\u0027s a good point. I think historically, it\u0027s just been mirror them between global nova.conf and compute nova.conf for ... ease?\n\nUpon auditing the options, I find for vnc, that these options are used by nova-compute and need to be in nova-cpu.conf:\n\n CONF.vnc.server_proxyclient_address\n CONF.vnc.keymap\n CONF.vnc.enabled\n CONF.vnc.server_listen\n CONF.vnc.novncproxy_base_url\n CONF.vnc.xvpvncproxy_base_url\n\nAnd these options are used by console proxies and need to be in nova_cellN.conf:\n\n CONF.vnc.xvpvncproxy_host\n CONF.vnc.xvpvncproxy_port\n CONF.vnc.novncproxy_host\n CONF.vnc.novncproxy_port\n CONF.vnc.vencrypt_client_key\n CONF.vnc.vencrypt_client_cert\n CONF.vnc.vencrypt_ca_certs\n CONF.vnc.auth_schemes\n\nMaybe it would be worthwhile to separate them to help convey what each set is for.",
