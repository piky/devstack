I assume there\u0027s some overlap between the options used by nova-compute and nova-conductor? If so, this disconnect is probably unavoidable but if not, we should probably break up \u0027configure_console_proxies\u0027 further.\n\nI think you touched on this in [1]\n\n[1] https://review.openstack.org/550141",
