      "message": "From the chat on IRC, I *think* the reason we need this \"enable before stop\" is because the per cell services enabled by start_nova_console_proxies aren\u0027t going to be persisted anywhere after a stack.sh run. So if we\u0027re doing a unstack.sh, we won\u0027t have the information anymore that the per cell services were enabled during stack.sh. So we have to enable them first before we can stop the processes (since stop_process checks \"if enabled\" first before it will do the stop).",
