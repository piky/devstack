      "message": "Tempest still use UPPER_CONSTRAINTS_FILE and switching to new one is challenging as old var is used in many place. let me set both which can help Tempest to move to TOX_CONSTRAINTS_FILE\n- https://github.com/openstack/tempest/blob/d141295f3e1f5b75618e3028f23519ee61749f52/tox.ini#L14\n\nfor 2nd comment, either one work both are same value, I can add UPPER_CONSTRAINTS_FILE\u003d$tmp_u_c_m too for keeping it consistent.",
