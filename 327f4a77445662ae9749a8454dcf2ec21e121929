      "message": "I have this comment in my systemd apparmor using Leap 15.0 \n# systemd maps \u0027restart\u0027 to \u0027stop; start\u0027 which means removing AppArmor confinement\n# from running processes (and not being able to re-apply it later).\n# Upstream systemd developers refused to implement an option that allows overriding\n# this behaviour, therefore we have to make ExecStop a no-op to error out on the\n# safe side.",
