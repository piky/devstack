      "message": "as discussed in QA meeting today[1], We have ipv6-only jobs almost in every projects and adding enw job and removing old one later will be more work. Let\u0027s enable it by default in ip6-only job and if any project is broken then they can disable it or fix. Once we enable it in existing ipv6-only job then we can send it on ML also to notify projects if they see the failure in their job.\n\n[1] https://meetings.opendev.org/meetings/qa/2022/qa.2022-03-29-15.00.log.html#l-155",

Or maybe\nthey\u0027re using the correct devstack stable/foo branch so I\u0027m just overthinking.",

      "message": "that is a good question. and you are right, they use the corrosponding devstack stable branch to pick the right job definition. As tempest job is inherited from devstack\u0027s devstack-tempest-ipv6 job and with devstack is branched the stable version of tempest job will use the devstack-tempest-ipv6 job definition from stable branch of devstack.",
