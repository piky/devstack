Let\u0027s enable it by default in ip6-only job and if any project is broken then they can disable it or fix. Once we enable it in existing ipv6-only job then we can send it on ML also to notify projects if they see the failure in their job.\n\n[1] https://meetings.opendev.org/meetings/qa/2022/qa.2022-03-29-15.00.log.html#l-155",
