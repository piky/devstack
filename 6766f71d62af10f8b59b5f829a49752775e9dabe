      "message": "Yeah I dunno. I\u0027m happy to remove the mkdir, although I think it\u0027d be better to do it in a separate patch. I wanted to make this as minor of a change as possible for the new behavior, because it makes it easiest to detect if something broke that way.\n\nIf you want to change something else, that\u0027s cool but IMHO we should do it before or after this patch which just addresses the persistence aspect.\n\nWhat else, besides the extra mkdir do you want to change?",
