I mean they don\u0027t support ppc, ok, but since we separated the ARCH in a var I fell that we should use it here (the supported values for this parameter are i386 or x86_64 by the docs https://www.eucalyptus.com/docs/eucalyptus/3.2/cli/euca-bundle-image.html so maybe we want to fail gracefully as well)",
