What\u0027s the problem you try to point to?\n\nNote that Q_PLUGIN_CONF_FILE may be not ml2, in which case we cannot expect that sample files are available (those plugins can still manage their config files statically, not using generator). That\u0027s why we should leave the if-else here.",

These vendor plugin configs are generated in other places and each plugin will copy it to \"/$Q_PLUGIN_CONF_FILE\" by themself.\n\nTherefore, this if-statement checks ml2_conf.ini.sample only.",

      "message": "Hirofumi, it is correct that the if statement copies ml2_conf.ini.sample only. \n\nIs this however because the underlying DevStack code does not following the paradigm as defined in \u0027lib/neutron_plugins/README.md\u0027? The paradigm is that each file in the plugins directory provides it name as the \u0027$Q_PLUGIN\u0027 variable and subsequently \u0027Q_PLUGIN_CONF_FILE\u0027 variable. If it followed the paradigm then you would have the likes of linuxbridge_agent and openvswitch_agent and therefore the need for the different core sample config file and this is where the if statement would be needed.\n\nMaybe the paradigm is obsoleted or maybe there is a bug? Either way, I think this is out the scope of this patch and therefore the changes need to follow the current code paradigm.",
