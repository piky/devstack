      "message": "1. We have a WIP patch to make CS10 work on opendev [1]. The infra folks are aware of the problem. TL;DR: base CS10 image can fully run on hardware that support x86-64-v3 microarch level. So we are trying on specific label (more info in the WIP patch). Next step is to update glean project (c.f [2]).\nIn the meantime we set up this third party CI job in order to unblock development on CS10.\n\n2. devstack-platform-centos-9-stream should not fail. I checked [3] it looks like fine. Maybe you\u0027re mentioning the fact it\u0027s non-voting ? CS9 should still be supported in the sort term, but for long term I don\u0027t know. I think this is something that shoud be discussed in next PTG\n\n[1] https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/diskimage-builder/+/934045\n[2] https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/diskimage-builder/+/934045/comments/0925c6b8_7290d02c\n[3] https://zuul.opendev.org/t/openstack/builds?job_name\u003ddevstack-platform-centos-9-stream\u0026skip\u003d0",

And now concedering testing runtime for 2025.2 we would be moving away from centos 9-stream as py310 is minimal python env., and direct replacement would be considering centos 10-stream but reading above looks there are still missing pieces.\nI found some WIP and DNM patches in above comments but not clear on what exactly is pending.",
