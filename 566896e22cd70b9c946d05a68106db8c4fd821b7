I\u0027ll talk to the folks in #virt about this more tomorrow but until then I\u0027m -W\u0027ing the stable backports.\n\nAbout the above comment ^^^ Lee updated the nova patch with this comment \"Unblocking this as while we have seen two hits of this since the master change merged it\u0027s still nothing like we were previously with multiple hits a day.\" So this is still worth to merge.
