      "message": "lib/tls has used OpenSSL for a while now AFAIK, this patch isn\u0027t adding any OpenSSL\u0027isms that aren\u0027t already present, it\u0027s just calling into existing functions. I too would like to see OpenSSL get factored out but that seems to me to be the work of another blueprint and patch set. I don\u0027t see any reason to hold this patch up simply because it\u0027s utilizing the existing functions.",
