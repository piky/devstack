      "message": "how much of this stack is still relevant? this patch in particular seems o.k., but likely also doesn\u0027t have much impact. I\u0027m also wondering how much the parallel execution may be detrimental in terms of memory pressure",

      "message": "Each of the patches at this point and below are small gains. Together they make an impact, but I haven\u0027t pushed on them because it\u0027s far from the lion\u0027s share of the gain. It\u0027s been a while so I don\u0027t remember what the individual or combined gains were.\n\nI don\u0027t think memory pressure is much of a concern during the stacking phase like it is when running tempest (or at least, not that I\u0027ve ever seen).\n\nIf you just don\u0027t want to see these in the list I can can abandon them and come back later if you prefer. I don\u0027t treat my gerrit listings as a queue, so it doesn\u0027t bother me to keep things open forever, but I understand it bugs some people :)",
