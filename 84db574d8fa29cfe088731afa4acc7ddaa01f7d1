      "message": "I should also add it here, yes. But, in fact, on a system without lvm a lot of command on lib/lvm will fail (e.g the call to \u0027pvs\u0027 l172). So I think a more useful fix for this more general problem would be to skip the call to every functions that do a lvm operation.\n\nBut for now, I just want to fix the unstack.sh part because the output of unstack is only a few lines long so any error hurts my eyes more :)",
