      "message": "So the difference is in v2 you created one endpoint which had public internal and admin components. In v3 you create 3 endpoints one with a public interface one with an internal interface and other with admin interface.\n\nThis is essentially trying to maintain the compatibility and i return the public endpoint id as at least it\u0027s something. It turns out that nothing ever checks the response here but previous comments said i should return something.",
