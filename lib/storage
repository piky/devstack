# lib/storage
# Interface for interacting with different block storage backends

# Dependencies:
# ``ENABLED_SERVICES`` must be defined

# ``STORAGE_BACKENDS`` will contain a list of available storage backends
# after sourcing this file.

# This is a wrapper for the specific storage backends available.
# Each storage must implement two functions:
#
# - install_storage_$STORAGE_TYPE
# - configure_storage_$STORAGE_TYPE
#
# and call register_storage $STORAGE_TYPE

# Save trace setting
XTRACE=$(set +o | grep xtrace)
set +o xtrace


# Register a storage backend
#
#   $1 The name of the storage backend
#
# This is required to be defined before the specific storage scripts are sourced
function register_storage {
    [ -z "$STORAGE_BACKENDS" ] && STORAGE_BACKENDS=$1 || STORAGE_BACKENDS+=" $1"
}

# Sourcing the storage libs sets STORAGE_BACKENDS with the available list
for f in $TOP_DIR/lib/storages/*; do
    source $f;
done

# ``STORAGE_BACKENDS`` now contains a list of the supported storages
# Look in ``ENABLED_SERVICES`` to see if one has been selected
for storage in $STORAGE_BACKENDS; do
    # Set the type for the rest of the backend to use
    if is_service_enabled $storage; then
        # Set this now for the rest of the storage functions
        STORAGE_TYPE=$storage
    fi
done
# If ``STORAGE_TYPE`` is unset here no storage was selected
# This is not an error as multi-node installs will do this on the compute nodes


# Functions
