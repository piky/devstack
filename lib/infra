# unfubar_setuptools() - Unbreak the giant mess that is the current state of setuptools

    # there is hope that upstream python packaging fixes this in the future
    echo_summary "Unbreaking setuptools"
    # Fedora based things break python by installing everything into /usr
    # even though it's a thing installing third party things. This is evil
    # and someone should be horsewhipped. Additionally, it means that
    # installing pip via pip, then uninstalling the rpm leaves the system
    # in a broken state.
