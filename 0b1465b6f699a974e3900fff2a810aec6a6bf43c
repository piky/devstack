      "message": "AFAICS there is no need for SERVICE_TENANT_NAME at all in this change, as all users have been removed.\n\nMaybe it\u0027s intentional that you\u0027re keeping it here aliased to SERVICE_PROJECT_NAME for external plugins or something that might still require it?\n\nIf so, I\u0027d prefer to see it (as mentioned) just a copy of SERVICE_PROJECT_NAME, but more importantly commented that although it seems unused, it is left behind for backwards compatibility.\n\nif it\u0027s not used, then remove it",
