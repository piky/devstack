The original line above sourcing stackrc should work fine, it includes local.conf\u0027s localrc section.  Otherwise you\u0027ll need to copy the logic from stackrc to get the local.conf localrc section here.",

      "message": "@Dean - The problem is that I cannot source stackrc, because that has a dependency on bash version 4. So I have two options here:\n - copy the logic from stackrc\n - ignore errors\n\nAlthough I don\u0027t like code duplication, I think I will copy the logic here. Or maybe extract that to a separate function? Let me upload a new patch, and see where it goes.",
