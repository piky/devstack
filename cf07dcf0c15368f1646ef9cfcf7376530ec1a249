At least somewhere else than stack.sh\n\nAlso, that would be great if that was controlled by a config flag (USE_UCA_FOR_LIBVIRT).\n\nFinally this PPA makes use get more than libvirt from UCA. Maybe it\u0027s worth considering http://askubuntu.com/a/170265 but that may be overkill and actually this may no be an issue.",

      "message": "Ya we can clean up the helper stuff (the use mirror check below is a good candidate too).\n\nAs for making UCA configurable my current thought on that is it shouldn\u0027t be. It just adds too much variance to the builds which affects wheel mirrors among other things. We have in the past stuck to not using UCA and I think we can potentially decide to use the UCA but shouldn\u0027t make it configurable.",
