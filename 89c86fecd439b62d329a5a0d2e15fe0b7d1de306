      "message": "First, it doesn\u0027t use setuptools etc. and relies on the the C build process. Second, there is a python file that is generated by that build process that contains a hard-coded path that is derived from running ./configure. So it would technically be possible for a distro build to treat that path one way, and the PyPI build the other.\n\nSo there are some issues to work through, and I think they will take longer than we\u0027d like to get the OVSDB-native patch merged.\n\nI plan on taking a look at getting it in PyPI, it just might take a bit of time.",
