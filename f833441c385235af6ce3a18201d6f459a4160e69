      "message": "These instructions are executed (and therefore the volume is mounted) inside the instance. The problem, is that some processes are using the mount, that\u0027s why the mount failed. I guess some hypervisors allow you to detach the volume, while that\u0027s still mounted inside the instance, but Xen does not allow that. So I had to find a way to disconnect the volume. I decided to shut down the instance - and I guess that is preventing the leaking mount points.\nAnyhow, let\u0027s stay on the safe side, so I put back the unmount command.",
