      "message": "I don\u0027t want to start an endless loop - originally it was like this, but Sean asked for it to be put here.\n\nI agreee with Clark that this seems like a global thing.  my research indicates any service that you try to start that is already started on Ubuntu will return this.  I think we happen to hit this with zookeeper because it is enabled after install.\n\nsince starting an already running service does nothing with systemd, i think having start_service just equalise the platforms is the right thing",
