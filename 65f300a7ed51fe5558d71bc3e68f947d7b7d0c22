      "message": "\u003e needed for anything else than ubuntu\n\nAre you sure?  At this point we only name 3 distro families and two of them need this and they are already specifically tested for above.\n\nWe need to be consistent with our assumptions...you originally took out a lot of the assumed defaults via \u0027else\u0027 in \u0027if\u0027 tests and now have a not supported else clause.  That\u0027s fine, so it would appear that your preference is to specifically call out the distros as required.  Do that here then too.  I think that also works for Sean\u0027s point for anyone adding Gentoo (or whatever) someday.",
