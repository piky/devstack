      "message": "I think it would be nice to not *force* the addition of YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS appended to LOGFILE.\n\nNot tested, but one thing you could do is just allow LOGFILE to have date formatting chars in it.  Ie, something like:\nif [ \"${LOGFILE#*%}\" !\u003d \"${LOGFILE}\" ]; then\n  # the LOGFILE has \u0027%\u0027 in it, let \u0027date\u0027 format output\n  LOGFILE\u003d$(date +\"$LOGFILE\")\nfi\n\nThen, if the user set LOGFILE\u003d\"mylog-%F-%H%M%S.log\" then they\u0027d get your formatting.",
