      "message": "Not really sure. Its important that these be highly visible to a reader of stack.sh if quantum is being used. If they were in lib/quantum, most people would never see them and know they can configure them. Also, I expect quantum to become the default networking solution during the Grizzly timeframe, so these variables will be applicable to the majority of devstack deployments.",

      "message": "Eventually all of the details of quantum will move to lib/quantum, similar to n-vol and cinder, et al.  I\u0027m not attempting to do quantum all at once like the others (keystone is next) since it is still in flux, but as chunks are revised it would be nice to get that started.\n\nThere is a second school of thought that the change that moves code should not make any other functional changes to make reviewing the diffs and troubleshooting simpler.  Let\u0027s go with that here.",
