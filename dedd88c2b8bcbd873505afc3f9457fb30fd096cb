      "message": "Doug, sorry, I am not quite getting what you meant here. if you look at lib/heat, they had # ENABLED_SERVICES+\u003d,heat,h-api-cfn,h-api-cw,h-eng. while in lib/ceilometer, it doesn\u0027t have comma at the beginning. In enable_service(), ${ENABLED_SERVICES} is passed in already as a broken string if there is no first comma  :) At the end of the day, it\u0027s just a comment, people probably can easily fix their localrc when they see the error message pops up when ./stack.sh fail",
