      "message": "How about using any of the existing logging alternatives?\n\nif LOGFILE is set, LOGDIR is the directory containing LOGFILE, usually /opt/stack/logs.  Alternatively, the usual pattern for persistent files would be $DATA_DIR/trove\n\n\nAdditional question, why are you editing the original sample file here?  I hadn\u0027t noticed that before...that really should be done in TROVE_CONF_DIR.",

      "message": "Thanks for the feedback Dean. trove-guestagent.conf.sample is read by the Trove guest agent (in a nested VM) and not anywhere in the DevStack VM (so there is no /opt/stack).\n\nRegarding why it\u0027s not in TROVE_CONF_DIR like the others, again it goes back to the fact that this file (and not the others in TROVE_CONF_DIR) are read on the nested VM. trove-guestagent.conf.sample is copied to the nested VM via rsync on boot of the nested VM. All of TROVE_DIR is rsynced I believe.",
