So in that case, you still need the rpm/deb files anyway.\n\nI don\u0027t really see any option but making it opt-in.  Various project\u0027s bindep sources are in various states of usefulness and automatically trying to install could cause all sorts of problems; and an additional complication is that they will have to specify particular profiles for the testing environment.\n\n[1] http://logs.openstack.org/68/626068/4/check/nodepool-functional-py35-src/6fe2280/",
