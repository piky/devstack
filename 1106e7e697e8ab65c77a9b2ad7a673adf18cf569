      "message": "So this chooses the first flavor in the list that is no the DEFAULT_INSTANCE_TYPE as the alternative flavor when DEFAULT_INSTANCE_TYPE is set, right?  And that is too small to resize to?\n\nthis all seems very non-deterministic ... \n\nwhat if you just took prior entry to DEFAULT_INSTANCE_TYPE?  Wouldn\u0027t that be basically the previous smallest size to DEFAULT_INSTANCE_TYPE?",
