I mean the \"awk\" part should return an empty string even if the network doesn\u0027t exist. (note that this script is not executed with set -o pipefail)",

      "message": "OK. IMO we should keep these semantically equivalent; instead here we are switching a \u0027list\u0027 with a \u0027show\u0027, whereas everywhere else we\u0027re still using \u0027list\u0027. Mine was not an oversight. When I switched to using the openstack client from neutron, I did this intentionally.",
