These were in our previous scripts we had but I guess they\u0027re not needed, thanks for pointing this out.\nI\u0027ll submit a new patch but I would actually like to add the screen_it calls back into this function, they tail the logs and make development more convenient for anyone running devstack with the midonet plugin. Those who don\u0027t use midonet won\u0027t be affected so it won\u0027t clutter their screen session.",
