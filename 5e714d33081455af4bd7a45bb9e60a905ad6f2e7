But we aren\u0027t enforcing the order of operations here instead we are just checking what to do based on being a controller or a subnode below.\n\nWe don\u0027t have an guarantee that the discover_hosts.sh below will actually run after this controller runs do we? because this playbook will run against all and the order is arbitrary?",
