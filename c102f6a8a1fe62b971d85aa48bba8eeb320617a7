      "message": "Although the full tempest suite is often not perfect, we\u0027ve been pretty good at keeping up with the Fedora cadence in at least keeping things basically working.\n\nMy preference would be just to say \"the latest/current Fedora version\" because this will always go out of date.\n\nStrictly, we\u0027d probably say \"the version of Fedora that the fedora-latest nodeset in the infrastructure gate is providing\", which we try to track upstream as fast as we can given any issues building the image, etc.  I admit this is probably too much for an initial readme :)",
