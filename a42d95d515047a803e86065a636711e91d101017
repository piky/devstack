      "message": "Yep - that makes sense. I decided to keep the clouds.yaml creation and population as close to when the accounts were created as possible since the original approach only laid the clouds.yaml file down after everything was created.\n\nBut - I agree, it does make things more complicated and if we\u0027re good just putting the entire file down early before the accounts exist then I\u0027m on board with that.",
