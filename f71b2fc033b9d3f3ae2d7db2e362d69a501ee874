      "message": "egrep is a tool for filtering lines, but PACKAGES is a space-separated string.  While I could go through the trouble of converting PACKAGES to lines, it seemed to make more sense to use a tool capable of stream editing like sed or perl.  Perl won out because it supports negative lookahead, but I could reimplement in sed if you\u0027d prefer.  \n\nThe catch with simply adding python-dev back at the end is that the package name is dependent on the platform - it\u0027s python-dev for deb distros, but python-devel for rpm distros.  Between having to conditionally add back the package name (duplicating it from the definition in files/{deb,rpm,suse-rpm}) or retaining it from PACKAGES, I think the latter is preferable.",
