      "message": "The issue is that restart via either init scripts or apachectl, etc is fragile. The init scripts often do the wrong things. I\u0027ve seen this across many distributions (fedora included), it is more prevalent in cases where you are running applications under the direction of Apache.\n\nThe real issue is that as soon as the \"stop\" finishes the \"start\" is tried via the init scripts (or apachectl, etc) and the port is still in use, this causes the start to fail.\n\nThis issue isn\u0027t extremely common, but when you have as many devstacks start up as we do in a given day, it doesn\u0027t take much to start showing up.\n\nI\u0027m happy to expand this comment if that would make it more clear.",

      "message": "If \"service httpd restart\" isn\u0027t restarting properly, then it\u0027s broken and a serious upstream bug.  What\u0027s the point of restart if it doesn\u0027t work?  :)\n\nI can\u0027t replicate this (although all I did was a loop for a while on a small rhel vm) but if this is seen on Fedora/RHEL/CentOS I will volunteer to file a bug and chase it up.  I couldn\u0027t see any linked failures in the attached bug but i\u0027m happy to have details\n\nI would only like to see this as a workaround for a specific known broken platform (gate by if is_[fedora|ubunut|etc]) and with a comment pointing to the upstream bug of why it doesn\u0027t work",
