      "message": "The issue is that restart via either init scripts or apachectl, etc is fragile. The init scripts often do the wrong things. I\u0027ve seen this across many distributions (fedora included), it is more prevalent in cases where you are running applications under the direction of Apache.\n\nThe real issue is that as soon as the \"stop\" finishes the \"start\" is tried via the init scripts (or apachectl, etc) and the port is still in use, this causes the start to fail.\n\nThis issue isn\u0027t extremely common, but when you have as many devstacks start up as we do in a given day, it doesn\u0027t take much to start showing up.\n\nI\u0027m happy to expand this comment if that would make it more clear.",
