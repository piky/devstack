It says\n\n\"If OS_CACERT is not set, get the default value which is $INT_CA_DIR/ca-chain.pem\"\n\nhowever, INT_CA_DIR/ca-chain.pem doesn\u0027t seem like it can possibly be there unless SSL was turned on.  And by turning on SSL, we\u0027ve ensured that OS_CACERT is saved into stackenv?  Thus making this irrelevant?",
