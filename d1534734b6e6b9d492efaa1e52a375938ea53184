But it is not the path MTU, which is what actually affects L3 encapsulations.\n\nPlaying the odds, it\u0027s *probably* going to work, but it\u0027s certainly not guaranteed to be right and it\u0027s actually very hard to prove it\u0027s wrong - which means even with this change devstack will mess up the MTU of deployments in a way the user will discover at a late stage.",
