      "message": "The number being 5 seems to be a bit of a hack in the first place - it was just a guess of how many images we should have if we\u0027re listing images for all drivers.\n\nI think that requiring a minimum of 3 images to be cached is possibly OK, but it\u0027s annoying that there is this hard-coded value.",
