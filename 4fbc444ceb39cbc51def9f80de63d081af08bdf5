      "message": "this should be a local, or better still you can just put it in directly as the third argument\n\nalthough, i also see this as being a sensible default but maybe you want to give people an argument to override it?  this does seem like a case where just leaving it up to localrc isn\u0027t in the users best interest",

Replacing config files is more of a power user thing, and setting your DNS is a pretty basic setting.\nThis begs the question of whether support should also be added for nova-net, but I\u0027m going to start with adjusting for content and style as suggested (n-net that might be a follow-on patch.)",
