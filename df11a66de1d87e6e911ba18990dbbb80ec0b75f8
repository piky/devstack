      "message": "A few things:\n\n1) This only supports the CoreOS image. It\u0027s the only one we have right now but might be worth saying explicitly here.\n\n2) So, we already have a script in ipa/imagebuild/coreos that should build a container from a trusty install. Now, it does setup and build in the same steps, but it should be easy to break up so that here, we only call a script with a couple of variables set.\n\nThis way if the build process changes, we can put it in one commit and have tests pass on old and new build methods rather than coordinating multiple repository merges with a gate breakage in the middle.",
