      "message": "Dean has previously asked me to do pip installs before the TRACK_DEPENDS bit in stack.sh, otherwise it misses the dependency tracking for the pypi mirror.\n\nAlso, do we need to stop the packaged nose being installed?  i think we\u0027ll end up with a similar thing happening with partially cleared out packages when pip removes things behind rpm\u0027s back?",

      "message": "Fair enough, I\u0027ll submit a new patch that avoids installing nose from packages.  \n\nThis points to a pretty big hole in devstack\u0027s use of os packages for dependencies.  Unlike python packages, no checks for the version of an os package are being performed.  Now that there is a canonical list of openstack dependencies, what do you think of providing a map of versioned python dependencies to the corresponding os package (if available) on fedora/centos/rhel?",
