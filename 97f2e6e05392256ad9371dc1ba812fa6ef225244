I\u0027m trying to think about how this works in a broader sense. It seems like all services should effectively be the same when it comes to working under either mod_wsgi or uwsgi.\n\nI\u0027m trying to figure out if there is an abstract specification for the set of attributes a service needs to do to go under one of these backends, so that we\u0027re not one off hacking them into devstack. Maybe next week we can etherpad it to figure out if that\u0027s doable, easily, or if we should give up and just plough forward here.",
