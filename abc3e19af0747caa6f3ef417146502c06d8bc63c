It\u0027s one thing when it\u0027s only used sequentially within a single file, but I don\u0027t think we should expect that no plugin etc will set a variable FILTERS in between it being set in lib/nova and being used in here.\n\nSince nobody could be setting it to anything else (it\u0027s \u003d set in lib/nova) I think it\u0027s safe to at least call it NOVA_FILTERS",
