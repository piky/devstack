      "message": "Sorry to comment this so late but when DVR is enabled, the qg-xxx device is not in qrouter namespace anymore but in snat namespace. This check will break due to time out which leads to a failure of installation.  I just found this in my latest test.\n\nMaybe we can add a check and stop the installation when both DVR and IPv6 are enabled?",
