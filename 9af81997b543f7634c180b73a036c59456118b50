      "message": "Yeah, this simplification seems to work on my system, it moved my primary IPv4 and IPv6 addresses from eth0 to br-eth0.\n\nThe only problem I saw was on unstack that even though the addresses moved back to eth0, they were unusable.  Unloading the openvswitch kernel module fixed it, so perhaps there is a missing ovs-vsctl del-port call?  Don\u0027t even know if it\u0027s related to this change.",
