      "message": "Always deleting and re-creating the bridge means it cannot have a physical interface as a port providing network connectivity. It also means the host cannot have an IP address on the bridge. Network connectivity would seem to be needed for the L3 agent, as well as for the openvswitch agent that would otherwise use this function to create its bridge (or it might use the same bridge as the L3 agent). Why not just pass --may-exist to the ovs-vsctl add-br command?",

      "message": "I think the reason why it deletes it is because it gets you back to a fresh setup. Alternately we could do ovs-vsctl list-ports and remove the ports (and not HOST_IP_IFACE if it is attached to that bridge).",
