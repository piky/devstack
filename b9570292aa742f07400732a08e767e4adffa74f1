      "message": "Yeah, I appreciate that this looks ugly. My issue with the local.conf approach is that you then need to synchronise that fixed_key between hosts during a multi-host deployment. That\u0027s additional work that I think we can avoid.\n\nIf we want real world testing of our encryption flows then the answer is to use Barbican. No amount of variation in the value of fixed_key would ever provide that so in the short term I don\u0027t mind this approach.",
