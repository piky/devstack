      "message": "If you run fresh devstack (without pre-cloned repo) then you might see the issue, what is whay i understood from clark comment in https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/devstack/+/791085\n\n-------------------\nClark Boylan\nPatch Set 2: Code-Review+2 Review-Priority+2\n\nthanks Ian. not sure why it did not occur in https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/devstack/+/735097\n\nI believe the reason it works in normal gating is that we \"preclone\" and configure all of the git repos before devstack runs. This ensures that depends-on works. But a side effect is that you can refer to code that won\u0027t be present if someone has cloned devstack and run stack.sh.\n\n-----------------------",

Not entirely sure what fresh devstack means as I have deployed it many times on fresh VMs but I will check again.\n\nMaking sure ensure-devstack works with the proposed change will test basically the end-user case of \"i cloned a fresh tree, have a existing config and i want it to work\"\n\nThat can be exercised against a change with \n\n[1] https://review.opendev.org/c/zuul/zuul-jobs/+/791117\n\nI\u0027m on the fence about putting ensure-devstack into the devstack gate.  The role is explicitly designed to \"use\" devstack, not test it, and there\u0027s been push-back in jobs that use it even collecting devstack logs.  But, OTOH, \"can I use devstack\" is also actually a pretty good test for devstack to do ...\n\nIf someone wants to propose ensure-devstack cloning from Zuul checkout, we can at least discuss it.\n\nBut at a minimum, any revert work should ensure that passes.",
