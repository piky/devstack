      "message": "If you run fresh devstack (without pre-cloned repo) then you might see the issue, what is whay i understood from clark comment in https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/devstack/+/791085\n\n-------------------\nClark Boylan\nPatch Set 2: Code-Review+2 Review-Priority+2\n\nthanks Ian. not sure why it did not occur in https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/devstack/+/735097\n\nI believe the reason it works in normal gating is that we \"preclone\" and configure all of the git repos before devstack runs. This ensures that depends-on works. But a side effect is that you can refer to code that won\u0027t be present if someone has cloned devstack and run stack.sh.\n\n-----------------------",
