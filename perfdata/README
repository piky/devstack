If you need to use a specific recheck of a given patch, use --event_id
$uuid. The event_id can be found at the top of a zuul job run and
applies (aside from retries) to all the jobs in that recheck.

NOTE1: Do not commit devstack-only job runs since they reset their
stats right before devstack ends, so what is left is just noise.

NOTE2: Non-devstack jobs (functional, unit, docs) will not have
performance profiles, so "no data" is expected.
