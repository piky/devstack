Otherwise we might run into the same problem where we pollute commands that run after this.\n\nWhat about popping the original values off, if present, running the admin command as system-admin, the resetting the original values?",

      "message": "Well the solution I proposed for this issue is in https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/devstack/+/780417/4/stack.sh which would only use OS_CLOUD everywhere in devstack and thus make it easy to override credentials. That patch needs a bit more of checking for possible side effects on consumers, though, which I haven\u0027t found the time for so far. If one of you would be interested in taking over, I think that would be a better solution than this workaround here, where I\u0027d not be sure whether even more variables would need to be nulled.",
