      "message": "the idea is to keep the config value exactly the same as it appears in local.conf. However, I realized that iniset will also add one \u0027space\u0027 in between \u0027\u003d\u0027 and the config value. In any case, the tests can be modified to reflect the above semantics.\n\nBut I think it\u0027s also desirable to remove the leading and trailing spaces. In that case, the above code can be simplified as:\n\n            cfg_value \u003d substr($0, index($0, \"\u003d\") + 1)\n            # Remove leading and trailing spaces.\n            sub(/^[ \\t]*/, \"\", cfg_value)\n            sub(/[ \\t]*$/, \"\", cfg_value)",
