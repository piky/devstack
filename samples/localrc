# Sample ``localrc`` for user-configurable variables in ``stack.sh``

# NOTE: Copy this file to the root ``devstack`` directory for it to work properly.

# ``localrc`` is a user-maintained setings file that is sourced at the end of
# ``stackrc``. This gives it the ability to override any variables set in ``stackrc``.
# Also, most of the settings in ``stack.sh`` are written to only be set if no
# value has already been set; this lets ``localrc`` effectively override the
# default values.

# This is a collection of some of the settings we have found to be useful 
# in our DevStack development environments. Additional settings are described 
# in http://devstack.org/localrc.html
# These should be considered as samples and are unsupported DevStack code.


# Minimal Contents
# ----------------

# While ``stack.sh`` is happy to run without ``localrc``, devlife is better when
# there are a few minimal variables set:

# If the ``*_PASSWORD`` variables are not set here you will be prompted to enter
# values for them by ``stack.sh``. 
ADMIN_PASSWORD=nomoresecrete
MYSQL_PASSWORD=stackdb
RABBIT_PASSWORD=stackqueue
SERVICE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD

# HOST_IP should be set manually for best results.  It is auto-detected during the
# first run of ``stack.sh`` but often is indeterminate on later runs due to the IP
# being moved from an Ethernet interface to a bridge on the host. Setting it here
# also makes it available for ``openrc`` to include when setting ``OS_AUTH_URL``.
# ``HOST_IP`` is not set by default.
HOST_IP=w.x.y.z


# Set DevStack Install Directory
# ------------------------------

# The DevStack install directory is set by the ``DEST`` variable. By setting it
# early in ``localrc`` you can reference it in later variables. The default value
# is ``/opt/stack``. It can be useful to set it even though it is not changed from
# the default value.
DEST=/opt/stack


# Using milestone-proposed branches
# ---------------------------------

# Uncomment these to grab the milestone-proposed branches from the repos:
#GLANCE_BRANCH=milestone-proposed
#HORIZON_BRANCH=milestone-proposed

#NOVA_BRANCH=milestone-proposed
#NOVACLIENT_BRANCH=milestone-proposed
#SWIFT_BRANCH=milestone-proposed


# Swift
# -----

# Swift is now used as the back-end for the S3-like object store. If Nova's
# objectstore (``n-obj`` in ``ENABLED_SERVICES``) is enabled, it will NOT
# run if Swift is enabled. Setting the hash value is required and you will
# be prompted for it if Swift is enabled so just set it to something already:
SWIFT_HASH=66a3d6b56c1f479c8b4e70ab5c2000f5

# For development purposes the default of 3 replicas is usually not required.
# Set this to 1 to save some resources:
SWIFT_REPLICAS=1

# The data for Swift is stored in the source tree by default (``$DEST/swift/data``)
# and can be moved by setting ``SWIFT_DATA_DIR``. The directory will be created
# if it does not exist.
SWIFT_DATA_DIR=$DEST/data
