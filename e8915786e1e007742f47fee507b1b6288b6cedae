Regular commits were never accepted:\n\nhttps://github.com/git/git/blob/69c786637d7a7fe3b2b8f7d989af095f5f49c3a8/builtin/clone.c#L471-L489\n\nThe only theoretic option I see is if this code was written prior to deployment of git that includes this patch: https://github.com/git/git/commit/920b691fe4da8115f9b79901411c0cc5fff17efe but it\u0027s very very old. And without the patch, git was checking out HEAD if it couldn\u0027t find the passed ref, so even with that it was always broken.",
