      "message": "I was hoping not to have to do any of that stuff for it. I definitely want to always have all the images available. Meaning, just because we didn\u0027t test some scenario against 2023.1 doesn\u0027t mean we don\u0027t need to *start* testing it once we realize there\u0027s a bug. For some benign formats, usable\u003dFalse might indicate \"this was not supported back then\" but I think I\u0027d rather handle that elsewhere. Like, I would not want to indicate that some image format is \"safe\" in 2023.1 because we didn\u0027t start testing for that issue until 2023.2. Anything in here that indicates a problem probably means a backport is required.\n\nSo, my gut tells me branchless. Sound reasonable?",
