      "message": "I put limits into the plugin for time and number of queries so that we know the maximum amount of \"error\" we could be absorbing by doing this too quickly. So I think that we\u0027re okay not being too concerned. Dumping this table was really just for informational purposes before I wiped the slate before starting tempest. It doesn\u0027t even *need* to stay here, although it was highly informational regarding the keystone behavior. I could also collapse it by query type to keep it smaller.\n\nIn the tempest case, which is what I think we really care about, the post-run matter seems plenty long and slow to have all of the stuff flushed out by the plugin before we go and collect the stats, so I think we\u0027re good there.",
