      "message": "Just to be clear, you would rather us not be able to test import image conversion (which has been in glance untested for several cycles) and Nova\u0027s use of that feature (which I just implemented and am trying to use now) until osc gains support for this mechanism? I have a hard time understanding that tradeoff, unless there is some actual technical reason. This does work in my testing here, so what is the actual hard dep on cloud.yaml? FWIW, people using this in the wild are doing it with glanceclient, just like many things in nova that aren\u0027t supported in OSC have to be done with novaclient today.",

      "message": "This seems like a great opportunity to work together and improve everyone\u0027s experience.\n\nhttps://review.opendev.org/#/c/737608/\n\nI just wrote a patch to use the already-existing support for image upload in sdk with the image creation workflow. Assuming this works (which, you know - let\u0027s assume there\u0027s a bug - and also probably will need to update an existing unittest and add another unittest to we\u0027ve covering both sides) it will, upon being released, immediately make osc use the interop image workflow if it finds it.\n\nI\u0027ll follow up with a patch add plumb through support for the --url import flag, but for now that patch should take care of it.\n\nIt seems like having a devstack config both with and without uwsgi for sdk\u0027s functional tests should cover both with and without image upload, yes?\n\nAnyway - I don\u0027t see any reason we can\u0027t get that patch finished up, landed and released in the next day ... at which point it\u0027ll mean we will have added support to sdk, zuul, openstackclient, ansible and salt.",
