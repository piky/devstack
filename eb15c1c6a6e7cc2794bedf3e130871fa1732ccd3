      "message": "Done. I should also explain where I see this going:\n\nWe\u0027ve deprecated eventlet and it\u0027s going away. So this is going away.\n\nWe\u0027d like to be testing with 2 different wsgi containers. One in the main gate and one in keystone.\n\nI\u0027d prefer the main gate test to be uwsgi_proxy. Currently it\u0027s mod_wsgi.\n\nOnce we get a uwsgi_proxy gate I\u0027ll get rid of the uwsgi gate and we can also get rid of the uwsgi deploy option. Maybe switch it to be the same as uwsgi_proxy?\n\nSo once this is done for keystone, we\u0027ll have 2 jobs -- one with mod_wsgi, the other using mod_uwsgi_proxy.\n\nIf this works well for us I think all the services should run this way.\n\nFurther work involves changing keystone to only accept on paths (/identity \u0026 /identity_admin) and not listen on the ports.",
