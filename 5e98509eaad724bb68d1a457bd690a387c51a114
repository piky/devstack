      "message": "Saw a job failure today on one of my patches where Nova times out waiting for the reimage external event from Cinder. In c-vol.txt you can see Cinder calls the external events API and Nova replying with 200, but Nova timed out (60s) just a few seconds before Cinder sent the external event call.\n\nI think it makes sense to bump up the timeout a bit to adapt to reimages occasionally taking a longer amount of time to complete.",
