local.conf - User Settings
==========================

``local.conf`` is a user-maintained setings file that is sourced in
``stackrc``. It contains a section that replaces the historical
``localrc`` file. See `the description of
local.conf <configuration.html>`__ for more details about the mechanics
of the file.
