      "message": "I\u0027m skeptical about this one. The last time we added support for openeuler, we had to remove it again, because it broke and nobody was around to fix it. How can we make sure that this doesn\u0027t repeat? Are there multiple persons supporting this effort? Could one of you regularly attend the weekly IRC meeting? If time of day is an issue, we could discuss that.\n\nIt also looks like the job seems to be running much slower than for other distros, do you have an explanation for this?\n\nSetting technical -2 because we are in feature-freeze now, so we need to wait until after stable/zed is branched in any case.",
