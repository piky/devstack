      "message": "ack re jobs \ni can try some of those yes i think part of the problem i have is the io perfromance and singel core performance on my macbook air is many times that of the ci vms so im not hitting the io bottelnecks those other change are hitting but yes ill try applying some or all of those tweaks.\n\ni was also considerign if i shoudl perhaps take over that patch if other are not workign on it and use it instead to maintain the review history but there is so much of it its hard to see why those tweaks were done.\n\nill try just addign all of them for now and see it that help but i actully think twaekign sysctl swapieness/dirty ratios and adding zswap might help alot.\n\ni think as is offten the case that the vms are iobound.\nif i can fix the cpu model selection to use \"max\" that will also help\nas the vms will run as quickly as possibel while still using qemu.",
