It would be worthwhile to detect this case and return an error.",

      "message": "What is set here will most likely be incorrect. If no createType is found, assume flat, so use disk type of preallocated. If createType is found, either it is a user error (descriptor supplied) or a legit disk (only two cases: monolithicSparse or streamOptimized)). We should set the former. Once the latter is supported in nova/cinder we can add that.",
