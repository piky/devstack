      "message": "Basically, because this change can merge independently of the nova changes. The reorderings that happen here are required for the nova change that depends on this one ( https://review.openstack.org/#/c/564067/ ) but have no impact otherwise. So that change actually does depend on this one, whereas this one has no impact for the common case.\n\nThe PLACEMENT_DB_ENABLED stuff has been present in lib/placement for a long time, but until the above wasn\u0027t exercised. That exercised pointed out these ordering problems.",
