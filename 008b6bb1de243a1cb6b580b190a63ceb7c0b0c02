This is interesting if you consider the service catalog as a system.\n\nFor example, someone could have `admin` on the identity service or compute service, making the authoritative surface area more specific to a single service as opposed to letting someone have admin authorization on the *entire* system.\n\nGranted, that doesn\u0027t exist yet, but something that could happen in the future. Maybe\n\n  --os-system-scope \u003csystem-scope\u003e\n\nmight be useful to do initially, where `all` is the only option that makes sense today.",
