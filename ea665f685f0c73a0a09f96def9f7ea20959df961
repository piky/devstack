      "message": "Hi Kyle,\n\nre: \tQ_L3_ROUTER_PER_TENANT is defined locally in _configure_neutron_l3_agent() as Q_USE_NAMESPACE. \n\nThat\u0027s l3 agent specific logic. l3_agent implementation happens to set Q_L3_ROUTER_PER_TENANT to true when namespace is used. \n\nBy defining the variable here, it makes it clear that we give a choice to plugin vendors to enable router-per-tenant configuration. In fact, some vendors define this in lib/neutron_plugins. So I thought it\u0027d make it clear if we had a definition here. \nDoes that make sense?",
