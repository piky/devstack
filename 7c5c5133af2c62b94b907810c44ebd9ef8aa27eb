      "message": "discover_hosts is a noop if there are no hosts to discover.\n\nAs for moving it into devstack-gate, I\u0027m not sure where that would live, or if it would be a call from devstack-gate back into devstack to do some end of deployment stuff (I\u0027m not that familiar with the stages of a devstack run). Either way I think this needs to live *in* devstack because it\u0027s going to be a required part of a multinode setup with cells v2.",
