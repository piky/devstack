      "message": "My concern still stands that if this variable should still be used anywhere with the original intention of directly creating a subnet from it, then having a /56 subnet will deviate from the standard of using a /64 for directly connected subnets and may cause all kinds of unexpected complications.",

      "message": "I intentionally used different defaults in [1], because these are not quite the same: a subnetpool is used to generate many fixed ranges and using FIXED_RANGE as a subnetpool prefix feels wrong. Bear in mind that the size of the subnet pool was a loooot smaller the way I had envisioned and we went over and above with [2]. Perhaps we can simply scale back or adjust these in devstack-gate.\n\nEither way, I would rather avoid making these the same, because they aren\u0027t.\n\n[1] https://review.openstack.org/#/c/282559\n[2] https://review.openstack.org/#/c/283289",
