I understand we want things to work, and work-around are ok, but I\u0027d like them to be identified as such.",

      "message": "This is correct fix for the current nova behavior with secured glance. I don\u0027t know details about nova plans for clients configuration. For now each client except glance has own configuration section. But glance uses parameters from [ssl] section which also contains settings for nova server SSL configuration. This looks strange for me, but it could be a part of some plan (nova cores approved https://review.openstack.org/#/c/72974 and it was merged).\n\nI expect that devstack is a reflection of the current state of openstack. If user sets USE_SSL\u003dTrue, I expect devstack installing openstack services working with each other. Once behavior of nova changes, devstack should be changed too. For now devstack wasn\u0027t updated after https://review.openstack.org/#/c/72974 and this CR is to address that.",
