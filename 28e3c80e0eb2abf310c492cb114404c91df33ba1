      "message": "Another approach might be to have your openstack command shim exec openstackclient when image upload commands are called. This has the advantage of avoiding a fragile reliance on PATH which other users might not be aware of.\n\nBut if the shim handles those cases directly it should mostly just work regardless of path.",
