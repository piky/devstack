      "message": "as the commit message described\n\n\"this will be a default extension driver as a example. And also, if not set it by default, networks like public/private which are created after the neutron-db-manage\u0027s update, will not include the port-sec value.\"\n\nThat setting it to deafault not only makes it as a example of extension driver, but also mean if leave ext driver empty as before, although the neutron-db-manage has upgrade the db  by using this file, the created public/private networks will not include the right value.\nThen when user want to add port-sec, besides add port-sec manually in conf file, they will also try to convert the public/private network db manually too.\n\nhttps://review.openstack.org/#/c/126552/15/neutron/db/migration/alembic_migrations/versions/35a0f3365720_add_port_security_in_ml2.py",
