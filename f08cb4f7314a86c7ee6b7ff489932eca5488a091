      "message": "I\u0027m not entirely sure this needs to be cleaned up. Rootwrap requires you whitelist dirs that it will run commands out of. When we move executables into $venv/bin we have to white list those and the overlap between $PATH and what we would end up with using service defaults + $venv/bin is basically complete.\n\nAs an alternative we can append the virtualenv dirs to the defaults if we like. I just don\u0027t know that it helps.",
