It doesn\u0027t quite make sense to the mental model I\u0027ve got going and it would be could to get that fixed.\n\nIn my mind I was thinking this was \"those services that tempest can rely on to be there\". Thus the plugin[1] should add to it if (and only if) it is enabled.\n\nClearly this means something else and whatever that something else represent a bi-directional coupling which is counterintuitive with the notion of a \"plugin\".\n\nHelp me understand, Obi Sean\n\n[1] https://github.com/openstack/ceilometer/blob/ccf824aa4359c43fd780661ef837f2da0e2bd9b8/devstack/settings#L38",
