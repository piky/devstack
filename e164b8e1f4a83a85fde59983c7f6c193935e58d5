      "message": "urgh, this is really really ugly.\n\ni guess we want to maintain compat but clearly the logic is wrong here for multiple packages.\n\n1) could we just make this call only take one package?  that would greatly simplify things\n\n2) could we just loop through the arguments, run \"dirname\" on them, and if the dir \u003d\u003d /opt/stack then we know it\u0027s a git install, rather than a pypi, and to try looking for test-requirements.txt?",

      "message": "about 1) do you mean like before but I just fix the extra issue ?\n\nabout 2) Looping through the arguments would work for the test-requriements.txt bug, but not for the python3 pip cmdline\n\nWhat is first package is python2 and second is python3.\nCurrently we install both for python2\n\nI will propose a new version that removes the \"optimization\" that installs all packages in one pip command.",
