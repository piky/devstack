The issue will likely also affect Ubuntu 22.04, so it is really good to have a chance to fix this early. My suggestion would be:\n\n- Create a bug report for horizon so they can deal with this\n- Run the f35 with horizon disabled until it is fixed so we can see coverage of the remainder of the deployment.",
