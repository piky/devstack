      "message": "Why override a user\u0027s locale settings? Known bugs? This seems to imply Openstack cannot run correctly with a properly set locale. We\u0027ve been encouraging users to make sure their locale is set properly and have been fixing many locale related bugs to assure Openstack works in the non-English speaking portions of the world.\n\nIf for some reason having LANG set causes a problem in some Openstack component would it not be better to fix that problem rather than mask it? This seems especially important in a developers environment.",
