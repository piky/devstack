      "message": "Why override a user\u0027s locale settings? Known bugs? This seems to imply Openstack cannot run correctly with a properly set locale. We\u0027ve been encouraging users to make sure their locale is set properly and have been fixing many locale related bugs to assure Openstack works in the non-English speaking portions of the world.\n\nIf for some reason having LANG set causes a problem in some Openstack component would it not be better to fix that problem rather than mask it? This seems especially important in a developers environment.",

In both situations, the environment locale look all the same.  \n\ncould you please give me some hints? what goes wrong here?\n\ncheck this: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/356826/\n\nthere are some math marks.",

      "message": "There are 2 requirements for things to work correctly.\n\n1. The user\u0027s locale must be configured correctly, the most important aspect of this is properly setting the LANG and/or LANGUAGE environment variable because the locale is driven off that environment variable.\n\n2. With Python 2 there must be code which reads the locale and sets the encoding according to the locale for the output stream (typically stdout and stderr). Python 3 does this as part of the language and no programmer intervention is required.\n\nSee these changes for examples of how to get properly encoded values from a terminal and output to a terminal:\n\nhttps://review.openstack.org/342914\nhttps://review.openstack.org/343035",
