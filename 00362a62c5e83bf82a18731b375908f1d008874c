      "message": "We should probably discuss this with Jamie Lennox - AIUI we\u0027re doing the wrong thing by using keystone_authtoken values inside heat, and also by requiring versioned endpoints.\n\nI wonder if we should instead move to a model where we just use the keystone endpoint, then discover the v3 endpoint, which we already do in some cases, but not all:\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/heat/blob/master/heat/common/context.py#L135\n\nI\u0027m keen to see us move away from v2.0, but it\u0027d be good to try to do that in a way that\u0027s well aligned with other projects and recommended approaches from the keystone folks.",
