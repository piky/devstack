It\u0027s reason is usage old cliff with newest DevStack. I can not understand how and why people can do it, but this bug exists. This fix prevents this bug occurence as well.\n\nBut in fact as so much time has passed, but no fix is commited, the best way is to fix the compatibility problem in cliff only.",
