      "message": "I think the use of the phrase \"distro provided\" breaks all expectations in this case. In my experience the distro installations will break _any_ kind of future pip installs if there are version requirements.  The easiest fix I\u0027ve found is to go back and remove any distro installed python packages _or_  pip install --force.\n\nThis patch isn\u0027t trying to fix the distro problem, merely the issue where you\u0027ve got a machine you\u0027ve run devstack on and would like it to upgrade the pip packages. Until this patch there was no straightforward way to do that.",
