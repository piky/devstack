I couldn\u0027t figure out why this patch was failing the Jenkins tests because devstack stood up fine with this patch on my machine, and I\u0027m not changing functionality, just adding a configuration option.  So I was just trying to troubleshoot in case it was something in my 9 lines added causing it to fail.  Do you have suggestions?",
