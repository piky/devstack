      "message": "can we take a minute to think about the interface here, before we add yet another function that will never go away ...\n\nwhat use is policy_add as it is?  \"I want to add my policy with this given policy_perm , but if the policy_name is already there, then just don\u0027t do anything\" does not seem to be a valid use case?\n\nI mean, at the very least this should be checking if the policy_name is there AND the policy_perm is the same before doing nothing?\n\nwhich is why you wrote policy_update no doubt.  \n\nSince policy_add doesn\u0027t seem useful as is, I think i\u0027d argue that we should just have the one interface of policy_add, which should just be modified to either add the policy, or update an existing policy if it is there.",

      "message": "I considered that, but didn\u0027t see anyone using it in devstack, which leads me to believe external plugins probably do. My concern (and reason I didn\u0027t modify it) was that someone might be relying on the behavior and I didn\u0027t want to change it from underneath them.\n\nI\u0027m happy to merge these two behaviors into policy_add if you think its OK though.",
