      "message": "this job is defined in openstack-zuul-jobs repo which inherits from project-config repo [2].\n\nThe previous parent, multinode, was inherited from zuul-jobs [3]. zuul-jobs also has multinode-fips jobs [4], however, I see that multinode-fips job has a different fips playbook than openstack-multinode-fips (from openstack-zuul-jobs repo).\n\nAs I noticed that we\u0027re gonna inherit from different repo (not just from a different job) I got a bit alerted, whether that\u0027s intentional. \n\nOn the other side I see that the multinode playbook used by the multinode job (from zuul-jobs repo) is the same as the one used by openstack-multinode-fips (from openstack-zuul-jobs repo), so there is no logical change from multinode perspective. We will just use the multinode playbook from a different repo (the same content). If others agree, I\u0027m ok with that.\n\n[1] https://opendev.org/openstack/openstack-zuul-jobs/src/commit/b3cad4f7a36929c13d9c74f2de24789741aa5d85/zuul.d/jobs.yaml#L2095\n[2] https://opendev.org/openstack/project-config/src/commit/e1f1945675800dbf888f06cefb53b07e7f92e694/zuul.d/jobs.yaml#L1267\n[3] https://opendev.org/zuul/zuul-jobs/src/commit/0354a8c52d7b0f56fdcbd5e7fa65536779152c34/zuul.d/general-jobs.yaml#L34\n[4] https://opendev.org/zuul/zuul-jobs/src/commit/0354a8c52d7b0f56fdcbd5e7fa65536779152c34/zuul.d/general-jobs.yaml#L42",
