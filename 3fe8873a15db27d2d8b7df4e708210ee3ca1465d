      "message": "fwict, we only ever checked for `uwsgi` so `WSGI_MODE` really should have been called `USE_MOD_UWSGI` and been a boolean. Based on Id5b2c67701bcc7b12c8e3764c7199d10f85df80f, it appears this option was intended to allow services to migrate from `mod_wsgi` to `mod_uwsgi` and was used to migrate placement and keystone across (we\u0027ve since removed support for this option - and the `mod_wsgi` deployment path in general - in these services via If17deabc35d35dca1d94b0d15d258769f347b130 and I2409385a87ee7cc7869bba9711bf95ab5fe77dc7, respectively). However, we were very inconsistent in other services. We never adopted the pattern for nova when we migrated from `mod_wsgi` to `mod_uwsgi`, opting to do a straight swap in change If2d7e363a6541854f2e30c03171bef7a41aff745, while neutron never supported deployment under `mod_wsgi` and went straight for `mod_uwsgi` in change I16a199b04858bfc03ef50d9883154dba8b0d66ea (but still called their option `NEUTRON_DEPLOY_MOD_WSGI` rather than `NEUTRON_DEPLOY_MOD_UWSGI`...ugh). It looks like mtreinish chose to use `WSGI_MODE` as the indication that glance should be deployed via wsgi rather that adding another option like `GLANCE_DEPLOY_MOD_WSGI` or `GLANCE_USE_MOD_WSGI` in change Ie98fb7da5e8ecfa49cd680b88139cb7034d5f88f.\n\nYou had change I79068ce0bd7414bc48ff534ee22f0de5d7b091cb decoupling these somewhat but that seems to be merely a way of allowing us to continue deploying e.g. placement and keystone under `mod_uwsgi` rather than `mod_wsgi`.",
