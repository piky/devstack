      "message": "I suggest to double check this on a number of different RedHat-based platforms. For example, on RHEL 6.7, os_VENDOR is \"RedHatEnterpriseWorkstation\", because it does not have an /etc/lsb-release file and then constructs the ID from the distro name in /etc/redhat-release, removing any blanks (and, as it seems, the word \"Linux\"). That value would not match the expression in the line above (line 360).",
