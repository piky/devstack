(read timeout\u003d60)\n\n(I did a quick logsearch about the above timeout error to see the frequency [1]. at first it shows that this error might have a relation to this patch merged in master @ Feb 20, but probably it is just a coincidence because we have log only from that date (~1 month), and zed has much less patches... anyway, let\u0027s try \u0026 see if we\u0027ll have more failures with this issue)\n\n[1] https://paste.opendev.org/show/bb8Xt8K7jKL4Fs2mxSKd/",
