      "message": "These changes work fine on the Fedora gate, I\u0027m just a bit worried that there may be consumers that explicitly install uwsgi into some weird path outside of $PATH that may break by this.\n\nIn that case we\u0027d probably need to use some global $UWSGI_BINARY variable that we just initialize to $(which uwsgi) once that it installed.\n\nOr maybe I\u0027m overthinking this and we can go ahead with the current patch and see whether anything breaks.",
