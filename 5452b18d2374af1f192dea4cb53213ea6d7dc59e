      "message": "seems strange to restart openvswitch in the branch for is_suse, since we are saying that we don\u0027t have packages to install.  Or am I misreading this?\n\nOr is the thought that the restart would fail, indicating to the operator that they need to install it manually, and once they do that it would work?",

      "message": "I was thinking we should remove it, as in general there is no need to restart OVS here if the install was done manually (after an install, restart with kernel module reload is required). \n\nOne might argue that it is valuable though, as this restart command will fail if the user did not manually install it.  Could be a useful indicator.  I\u0027m fine either way :)",
