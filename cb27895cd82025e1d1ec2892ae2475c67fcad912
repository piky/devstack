      "message": "Not sure if the keepers of stack.sh style will like setting a tempest-only variable in the main stack.sh .  It doesn\u0027t seem like there are any other examples of this.  It might be cleaner to set this value in lib/tempest itself, based on a test of whether quantum is enabled.  It seems like there are examples of this pattern already in that file.  \n\nI\u0027ll let someone more familiar with the style guidelines for all of devstack comment if they think this is an issue.",
