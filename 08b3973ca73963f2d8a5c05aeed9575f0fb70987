      "message": "@Ian: You\u0027re right, it is the default if nothing is specified. The same is true for n-spice above in line 582. \nI still think it makes sense in the case when one enables the serial console but doesn\u0027t enable the serialproxy service. The result will be a guest which gets created with a serial console device but is not accessible. The change makes it a little more consistent IMO.",

      "message": "well that\u0027s an interesting point too ... would anyone want to do that?  does n-sproxy disabled imply that you would *never* want serial_console enabled?  \n\nin multi-node, where there\u0027s one proxy but multiple hosts, on non-proxy hosts wouldn\u0027t you have n-sproxy disabled and then have this setup in local.conf?\n\nin that case it seems like a race to see who gets their entry in the config file last...",
