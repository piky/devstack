Not sure if they use python3 or not, but they definitely use EPEL--and if we are dropping python2 support...I don\u0027t see why we wouldn\u0027t test it.",

      "message": "Ian you are making too much assumptions here. DevStack must provide what OpenStack developers wants from it. It doesn\u0027t matter the reason why we want Python3 on CentOS 7. The point is the decision is on DevStack users and not on us. It has been a very desired feature and RDO cannot provide the same experience as DevStack just because it is not DevStack. As Python developer I want to stop using Python 2 because it is wasting my time supporting both language dialects, but in the same time I want to test my code on CentOS because it carries different binary code (kernel, OVS, compiler, ssl, etc.) than Ubuntu. I want to test my code on both distros because it is a good thing to do and it is convenient to me. What do you know about what is convenient to me and other DevStack users need?",
