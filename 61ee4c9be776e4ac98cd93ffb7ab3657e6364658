And you should actually not touch neutron-legacy but lib/neutron since that\u0027s where new development happens.\n\nThere is a patch for devstack that allows services to add new config files to load: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/342493/ After it\u0027s in, you should be able to use the functionality in octavia plugin.",

      "message": "The Octavia exclusion was made per Stephen\u0027s comment on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/299998/\n\nCurrently, when you configure devstack to run with Octavia, you will notice the following:\n1. q-svc get the following config files: neutron.conf and plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini\n2. o-api, o-cw, o-hk, o-hm get the following config file: octavia.conf\n\nSo none of the above services use neutron_lbaas.conf (Even though the service_auth and service_providers sections were configured).\nThe octavia.conf file also has a keystone_authtoken section, so that can explain why it does not need to read it from neutron_lbaas.conf\n\nStephen, could you please add more details about this?",
