      "message": "Unlike \"pip-python uninstall pycrypto\", uninstalling python-nose behind rpm\u0027s back doesn\u0027t seem to leave any .pyc etc files around.  Not sure why that is, but a slight concern is that might change. \n\nmaybe an explicit uninstall then a test for any remaining traces in /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages might be good before re-install?\n\nmaybe not worth the effort, what do you think?",
