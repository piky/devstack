      "message": "Unlike \"pip-python uninstall pycrypto\", uninstalling python-nose behind rpm\u0027s back doesn\u0027t seem to leave any .pyc etc files around.  Not sure why that is, but a slight concern is that might change. \n\nmaybe an explicit uninstall then a test for any remaining traces in /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages might be good before re-install?\n\nmaybe not worth the effort, what do you think?",

      "message": "Forcing the removal of python-nose doesn\u0027t seem any better than pip installing nose on top of it.  I\u0027m relying on the fact that the version of nose that gets installed by pip will take precedence over the os package, and the fact that nose is not long for openstack (replaced by testr and friends).",
