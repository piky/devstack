The \"skip-level\" jobs, that work with 2024.1 (two releases back),\ncannot yet work with WSGI because:\n* For ML2/OVS it was refactored and fixed in 2024.2\n* For ML2/OVN it was implemented in 2024.2\n\nWe need to wait until 2025.2 to remove this flag (or not testing the grenade \"skip-level\" jobs).\n\n[1]https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/neutron/+/935668",
